# srand 
void srand (unsigned int seed);
### Initialize random number generator
The pseudo-random number generator is initialized using the argument passed as seed.

For every different seed value used in a call to srand, the pseudo-random number generator can be expected to generate a different succession of results in the subsequent calls to rand.

Two different initializations with the same seed will generate the same succession of results in subsequent calls to rand.

If seed is set to 1, the generator is reinitialized to its initial value and produces the same values as before any call to rand or srand.

In order to generate random-like numbers, srand is usually initialized to some distinctive runtime value, like the value returned by function time (declared in header <ctime>). This is distinctive enough for most trivial randomization needs.

```C++
/* srand example */
#include <stdio.h>      /* printf, NULL */
#include <stdlib.h>     /* srand, rand */
#include <time.h>       /* time */

int main ()
{
  printf ("First number: %d\n", rand()%100);
  srand (time(NULL));
  printf ("Random number: %d\n", rand()%100);
  srand (1);
  printf ("Again the first number: %d\n", rand()%100);

  return 0;
}
```
```
First number: 41
Random number: 13
Again the first number: 41
```

# rand 
int rand (void);
### Generate random number
Returns a pseudo-random integral number in the range between 0 and RAND_MAX.
This number is generated by an algorithm that returns a sequence of apparently non-related numbers
each time it iscalled. This algorithm uses a seed to generate the series,
which should be initialized to some distinctive value using function srand.
```C++
/* rand example: guess the number */
#include <stdio.h>      /* printf, scanf, puts, NULL */
#include <stdlib.h>     /* srand, rand */
#include <time.h>       /* time */

int main ()
{
  int iSecret, iGuess;

  /* initialize random seed: */
  srand (time(NULL));

  /* generate secret number between 1 and 10: */
  iSecret = rand() % 10 + 1;

  do {
    printf ("Guess the number (1 to 10): ");
    scanf ("%d",&iGuess);
    if (iSecret<iGuess) puts ("The secret number is lower");
    else if (iSecret>iGuess) puts ("The secret number is higher");
  } while (iSecret!=iGuess);

  puts ("Congratulations!");
  return 0;
}
```
```
Guess the number (1 to 10): 5
The secret number is higher
Guess the number (1 to 10): 8
The secret number is lower
Guess the number (1 to 10): 7
Congratulations!
```
# time 
time_t time (time_t* timer);
### Get current time
Get the current calendar time as a value of type time_t.

The function returns this value, and if the argument is not a null pointer, it also sets this value to the object pointed by timer.

The value returned generally represents the number of seconds since 00:00 hours, Jan 1, 1970 UTC (i.e., the current unix timestamp). Although libraries may use a different representation of time: Portable programs should not use the value returned by this function directly, but always rely on calls to other elements of the standard library to translate them to portable types (such as localtime, gmtime or difftime).

```C++
/* time example */
#include <stdio.h>      /* printf */
#include <time.h>       /* time_t, struct tm, difftime, time, mktime */

int main ()
{
  time_t timer;
  struct tm y2k = {0};
  double seconds;

  y2k.tm_hour = 0;   y2k.tm_min = 0; y2k.tm_sec = 0;
  y2k.tm_year = 100; y2k.tm_mon = 0; y2k.tm_mday = 1;

  time(&timer);  /* get current time; same as: timer = time(NULL)  */

  seconds = difftime(timer,mktime(&y2k));

  printf ("%.f seconds since January 1, 2000 in the current timezone", seconds);

  return 0;
}
```
```414086872 seconds since January 1, 2000 in the current timezone```

# atoi
int atoi (const char * str);
### Convert string to integer
Parses the C-string str interpreting its content as an integral number, which is returned as a value of type int.

The function first discards as many whitespace characters (as in isspace) as necessary until the first non-whitespace character is found. Then, starting from this character, takes an optional initial plus or minus sign followed by as many base-10 digits as possible, and interprets them as a numerical value.

The string can contain additional characters after those that form the integral number, which are ignored and have no effect on the behavior of this function.

If the first sequence of non-whitespace characters in str is not a valid integral number, or if no such sequence exists because either str is empty or it contains only whitespace characters, no conversion is performed and zero is returned.

```C
/* atoi example */
#include <stdio.h>      /* printf, fgets */
#include <stdlib.h>     /* atoi */

int main ()
{
  int i;
  char buffer[256];
  printf ("Enter a number: ");
  fgets (buffer, 256, stdin);
  i = atoi (buffer);
  printf ("The value entered is %d. Its double is %d.\n",i,i*2);
  return 0;
}
```
```
Enter a number: 73
The value entered is 73. Its double is 146.
```

# strcmp
int strcmp (const char* str1, const char* str2);
### The strcmp() function takes two strings and return an integer.
The strcmp() compares two strings character by character. If the first character of two strings are equal, next character of two strings are compared. This continues until the corresponding characters of two strings are different or a null character '\0' is reached.

It is defined in string.h header file.

```C
#include <stdio.h>
#include <string.h>

int main()
{
    char str1[] = "abcd", str2[] = "abCd", str3[] = "abcd";
    int result;

    // comparing strings str1 and str2
    result = strcmp(str1, str2);
    printf("strcmp(str1, str2) = %d\n", result);

    // comparing strings str1 and str3
    result = strcmp(str1, str3);
    printf("strcmp(str1, str3) = %d\n", result);

    return 0;
}
```
```
strcmp(str1, str2) = 32
strcmp(str1, str3) = 0
```

# fopen
FILE * fopen ( const char * filename, const char * mode );
### Open file
Opens the file whose name is specified in the parameter filename and associates it with a stream that can be identified in future operations by the FILE pointer returned.

The operations that are allowed on the stream and how these are performed are defined by the mode parameter.

The returned stream is fully buffered by default if it is known to not refer to an interactive device (see setbuf).

The returned pointer can be disassociated from the file by calling fclose or freopen. All opened files are automatically closed on normal program termination.

The running environment supports at least FOPEN_MAX files open simultaneously.
```C
/* fopen example */
#include <stdio.h>
int main ()
{
  FILE * pFile;
  pFile = fopen ("myfile.txt","w");
  if (pFile!=NULL)
  {
    fputs ("fopen example",pFile);
    fclose (pFile);
  }
  return 0;
}
```
# memset
void * memset ( void * ptr, int value, size_t num );
### Fill block of memory
Sets the first num bytes of the block of memory pointed by ptr to the specified value (interpreted as an unsigned char).

### Parameters
ptr - Pointer to the block of memory to fill.
value - Value to be set. The value is passed as an int, but the function fills the block of memory using the unsigned char conversion of this value.
num - Number of bytes to be set to the value.

```C
/* memset example */
#include <stdio.h>
#include <string.h>

int main ()
{
  char str[] = "almost every programmer should know memset!";
  memset (str,'-',6);
  puts (str);
  return 0;
}
```
```
------ every programmer should know memset!
```
